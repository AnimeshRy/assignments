# Document Management and RAG-based Q&A Application Architecture

This document outlines the architecture, design decisions, and implementation details of the Document Management and RAG-based Q&A Application.

## System Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

1. **API Layer**: FastAPI routes and endpoints that handle HTTP requests and responses
2. **Service Layer**: Business logic and domain services
3. **Data Access Layer**: Database models and data access patterns
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: Database connection, configuration, and external services

## Design Decisions

### 1. Asynchronous Programming

The application uses FastAPI's asynchronous capabilities and SQLAlchemy's async features to handle concurrent requests efficiently. This design choice allows the application to:

- Handle many concurrent connections
- Efficiently process I/O-bound operations (database queries, embedding generation)
- Provide better resource utilization

### 2. Database Schema

The database schema is designed to support the core features of document management and RAG-based Q&A:

- **User Model**: Stores user information and authentication details
- **Document Model**: Stores document metadata and content
- **DocumentChunk Model**: Stores document chunks with embeddings for efficient retrieval
- **QASession Model**: Represents a session with selected documents for Q&A
- **Question Model**: Stores questions and answers for each QA session

The schema uses relationships to maintain data integrity and support efficient queries.

### 3. Embedding Generation and Storage

For embedding generation, we use the Sentence Transformers library with the "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" model, which provides a good balance between performance and accuracy. The embeddings are stored in the database as ARRAY(Float) types in PostgreSQL, allowing for efficient vector operations.

The document processing flow:
1. Document is uploaded/created
2. Document is chunked into smaller pieces
3. Embeddings are generated for each chunk
4. Chunks and embeddings are stored in the database

### 4. RAG Implementation

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system works as follows:

1. **Retrieval**: When a question is asked, the system:
   - Retrieves document chunks from the selected QA session
   - Computes the embedding for the question
   - Finds the most similar chunks using cosine similarity

2. **Generation**: The system then:
   - Uses the retrieved chunks as context
   - Generates an answer using a language model (in this implementation, we use a mock LLM)
   - Returns the answer along with source information

This approach allows the system to provide answers based on the specific documents selected by the user.

### 5. API Design

The API is designed following RESTful principles with clear resource-based endpoints:

- `/api/auth`: Authentication endpoints
- `/api/users`: User management
- `/api/documents`: Document management
- `/api/qa`: Q&A functionality

Each endpoint follows consistent patterns for CRUD operations and error handling.

### 6. Security

The application implements several security measures:

- Password hashing using bcrypt
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (regular users vs. superusers)
- Input validation using Pydantic schemas
- Database query parameterization to prevent SQL injection

## Scalability Considerations

The application is designed with scalability in mind:

1. **Database Scalability**:
   - Efficient indexing on frequently queried fields
   - Pagination for large result sets
   - Asynchronous database access

2. **Embedding Generation Scalability**:
   - Chunking of documents to process large texts
   - Potential for distributed embedding generation

3. **API Scalability**:
   - Stateless API design for horizontal scaling
   - Containerization for easy deployment and scaling

4. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Caching layer for frequently accessed data
   - Background workers for processing large documents
   - Distributed vector search for large embedding collections

## Testing Strategy

The application includes a comprehensive testing strategy:

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Testing interactions between components
3. **API Tests**: Testing the API endpoints
4. **Performance Tests**: Ensuring the system can handle expected load

Tests are implemented using pytest and pytest-asyncio for asynchronous test support.

## Deployment

The application is containerized using Docker and can be deployed using Docker Compose or Kubernetes. The CI/CD pipeline automates testing, building, and deployment processes.

## Third-Party Libraries

The application uses several third-party libraries:

1. **FastAPI**: Web framework for building APIs
2. **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database access
3. **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management
4. **Sentence Transformers**: For generating embeddings
5. **LangChain**: For RAG implementation
6. **Alembic**: For database migrations
7. **Pytest**: For testing

## Conclusion

The Document Management and RAG-based Q&A Application is designed to be robust, scalable, and maintainable. The architecture follows best practices for modern web applications and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.
